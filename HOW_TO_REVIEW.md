To make Edits to Sauce School modules, you can find the file, make edits, then submit a new branch, take the following steps on

**https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce-school**

**Note** – Each Module in sauce school is created in one markdown file. For example, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03 etc are all a part of the Module4_SeleniumPython.md file

1. Find the codelab module in the sauce-school repo. All modules are in the sauce-school/codelabs directory (some may be in sauce-school/codelabs/Drafts)
