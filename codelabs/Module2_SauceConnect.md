# Module 2 â€“ Sauce Connect for Admins

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## 2.01 What You'll Learn
Duration: 0:01:00

## 2.02 Shared Tunnels
Duration: 0:06:00

In this section, you will learn about using shared tunnels, and edit the code to run a test using the tunnel and [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ. This lesson covers:

* The different permissions for Sauce Labs accounts, and how they affect tunnels
* How to start a shared tunnel that others can use
* How to update Java test code to run your test through a shared tunnel by updating the `parentTunnel` capability.

: If you clone & fork or download [the example repo called Selenium_Course_Example_Code](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06), make sure you navigate to the _java/Mod4/4.06_ directory and open and run your tests from there. Learn more about [setting up a Java test environment](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SeleniumJava/index.html?index=..%2F..SeleniumJava#4).

Shared tunnels are tunnels that are started by one person in an organization, that can be used by other inidividuals within that organization. Though anyone can run the `-s` flag, tunnels are only shared with others if you are and Admin or Team Admin in your Sauce Labs account.

### Sauce Labs Account Access
There are different roles that individuals in an organization can have within Sauce Labs. The most common ones include:

#### Org Admin
This is the highest level of access for a Sauce Labs Account. These user can:
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels (in any team)
* Can manage account, and add and move members between teams
* Can promote peoples' access rights to Team or Org Admins
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone in the organization
* Can stop all tunnels in their organization

#### Team Admins
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels in their team
* Can manage accounts on their team, and add people to their team, and move members from the _default_ team
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone on their team

#### Team Member
* Can run tests on their own tunnels or on tunnels that are shared with them
* Can manage their own account
* Can see team members' tests (if that is available for their organization)
* Can start tunnels that others in their team can use

### Start a Shared Tunnel

Starting a shared tunnel is as easy as adding a flag when you run your tunnel, [like you did earlier](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SauceConnect/index.html?index=..%2F..sauceconnect#start-the-tunnel). The basic steps include:

* Navigate to the folder where you have the Sauce Connect Software downloaded
* Start a tunnel with the command, adding the `-s` flag to the end:

```
bin/sc -u Lindsayw34 -k xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxx -i Lindsayw34_tunnel_id -s
```
<img src="assets/SC2.02B.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="650"/>

Now on the Sauce Labs dashboard, under the **Tunnels** tab, you can see a shared tunnel on your dashboard:

<img src="assets/SC2.02C.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

#### Tunnel Information
In order for other users in your organization to utilize your test, they will need two pieces of information, the **Tunnel Name** and **Owner**

In this example, the tunnel name is `walkerlj_tunnel_id` and the owner is `walkerlj`.

### Using a Shared Tunnel with a Java Test
Using a shared tunnel to run your test is done in a very similar way, you simply need to add an extra capabilities.

To use a shared tunnel create or copy [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ.

#### Update `BaseTest.java`
To run a test through this login to a user account that is different than the use who is running the test, and check the **Tunnels** dashboard to find the the **Tunnel Name** and **Owner** for the tunnel:

<img src="assets/SC2.02D.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

Now open your copy of the [example test](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06).

Navigate to the directory _src/test/java_ and look in the `tests` directory to open `BaseTest.java`. Find the set of capabilities in the `before()` method for for `(host.equals("saucelabs")) {`:


  ```
  @Override
        protected void before() throws Exception {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                MutableCapabilities sauceOptions = new MutableCapabilities();
                sauceOptions.setCapability("username", sauceUser);
                sauceOptions.setCapability("accessKey", sauceKey);
                sauceOptions.setCapability("name", testName);
                MutableCapabilities capabilities = new
                // add tunnel capabilities
                MutableCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browserName);
                capabilities.setCapability("browserVersion", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platformName", platformName);
                capabilities.setCapability("sauce:options", sauceOptions);
                String sauceUrl = String.format("https://ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub");
                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(sauceUrl), capabilities);
                sessionId = ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getSessionId().toString();
                sauceClient = new SauceREST(sauceUser, sauceKey, DataCenter.US);

            }
  ```

At the bottom of the list of `sauceOptions`, underneath the `sauceOptions.setCapability("name", testName)` add in two more capabilities; `tunnelIdentifier` (for **Tunnel Name**) and 'parentTunnel' (for **Owner**):

```
    sauceOptions.setCapability("tunnelIdentifier", "walkerlj_tunnel_id"     
    sauceOptions.setCapability("parentTunnel", "walkerlj");
```

Now you can run `mvn clean test` to run the test on Sauce Labs.

## 2.03 High Availability Tunnels
Duration: 0:05:00


In this section, you will learn about using **high availability tunnels**. These are persistent tunnels that are always available to an organization or team (they are't stopped after a test). Typically, instances of the high availability tunnel are created and spun up with the same name (on the same server or different servers), typically as a shared tunnel so users in an organization can access tunnels as needed without having to start their own.

and edit the code to run a test using the tunnel and [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ. This lesson covers:

* How to start a new shared tunnel alongside an existing tunnel, with the same name
* How to update Java test code to run your test through a shared tunnel by updating the `--no-removing-colliding-tunnels` capability.
