Duration: 0:01:00

### What You'll Need
In order to follow along with the course, you will need a few things set up ahead of time:

* A Sauce [Username and Access Key](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)
* The [Tunnel Name](https://app.saucelabs.com/tunnels) of a running tunnel
* A copy of [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/)
* An App to build and test in GitHub Actions
* A computer with access to saucelabs.com ([See Allow Listing Doc](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/system-requirements/#allowlisting-for-restricted-networks))
* Example [Selenium Java test code](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions/tree/main/java_tests) (Optional)

This tutorial gives examples written in Java, using the JUnit4 test runner, as well as the Maven build tool. If you would like to follow along, you can [download or fork and clone this project](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions).

### Skills & Knowledge

* Understand shared tunnels and pools tunnels, and when to use them
* Start high availability tunnels for use by many users within a team or organization
* Learn how to create bash scripts that will start and kill your tunnels, and use crontab jobs to schedule these to restart tunnels every 24 hours
* Understand the use cases for Sauce Connect with your you system under test
* Understand when you should use On Demand or Persistent tunnels
* Work through an example of setting up Sauce Connect in CI, using GitHub actions to start an on-demand tunnel


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## 2.02 Shared Tunnels
Duration: 0:06:00

In this section, you will learn about using shared tunnels, and edit the code to run a test using the tunnel and [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ. This lesson covers:

* The different permissions for Sauce Labs accounts, and how they affect tunnels
* How to start a shared tunnel that others can use
* How to update Java test code to run your test through a shared tunnel by updating the `parentTunnel` capability.

#### Note
Negative
: Not familiar with Java automated testing? Learn more about [setting up a Java test environment](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SeleniumJava/index.html?index=..%2F..SeleniumJava#4). You will need to make sure you have your [Sauce Credentials set up as environment variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K1Eu0eTha8) so the tests will run.

Shared tunnels are tunnels that are started by one person in an organization, that can be used by other inidividuals within that organization. Though anyone can run the `-s` flag, tunnels are only shared with others if you are on the same Sauce Labs team, or Team Admin in your Sauce Labs account.

### Sauce Labs Account Access
There are different roles that individuals in an organization can have within Sauce Labs. The most common ones include:

#### Org Admin
This is the highest level of access for a Sauce Labs Account. These user can:
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels (in any team)
* Can manage account, and add and move members between teams
* Can promote peoples' access rights to Team or Org Admins
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone in the organization
* Can stop all tunnels in their organization

#### Team Admins
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels in their team
* Can manage accounts on their team, and add people to their team, and move members from the _default_ team
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone on their team

#### Team Member
* Can run tests on their own tunnels or on tunnels that are shared with them
* Can manage their own account
* Can see team members' tests (if that is available for their organization)
* Can start tunnels that others in their team can use

### Start a Shared Tunnel

Starting a shared tunnel is as easy as adding a flag when you run your tunnel, [like you did earlier](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SauceConnect/index.html?index=..%2F..sauceconnect#start-the-tunnel). The basic steps include:

* Navigate to the folder where you have the Sauce Connect Software downloaded
* Start a tunnel with the command, adding the `-s` flag to the end:

```
bin/sc -u Lindsayw34 -k xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxx -i Lindsayw34_tunnel_id -s
```
<img src="assets/SC2.02B.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="650"/>

Now on the Sauce Labs dashboard, under the **Tunnels** tab, you can see a shared tunnel on your dashboard:

<img src="assets/SC2.02C.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

#### Tunnel Information
In order for other users in your organization to utilize your test, they will need two pieces of information, the **Tunnel Name** and **Owner**

In this example, the tunnel name is `walkerlj_tunnel_id` and the owner is `walkerlj`.

### Using a Shared Tunnel with a Java Test
Using a shared tunnel to run your test is done in a very similar way, you simply need to add an extra capabilities.

To use a shared tunnel create or copy [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ.

#### Update `BaseTest.java`
To run a test through this login to a user account that is different than the use who is running the test, and check the **Tunnels** dashboard to find the the **Tunnel Name** and **Owner** for the tunnel:

<img src="assets/SC2.02D.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

Now open your copy of the [example test](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions/tree/main/java_tests).

Navigate to the directory _src/test/java_ and look in the `tests` directory to open `BaseTest.java`. Find the set of capabilities in the `before()` method for for `(host.equals("saucelabs")) {`:


  ```
  @Override
        protected void before() throws Exception {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                MutableCapabilities sauceOptions = new MutableCapabilities();
                sauceOptions.setCapability("username", sauceUser);
                sauceOptions.setCapability("accessKey", sauceKey);
                sauceOptions.setCapability("name", testName);
                MutableCapabilities capabilities = new
                // add tunnel capabilities
                MutableCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browserName);
                capabilities.setCapability("browserVersion", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platformName", platformName);
                capabilities.setCapability("sauce:options", sauceOptions);
                String sauceUrl = String.format("https://ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub");
                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(sauceUrl), capabilities);
                sessionId = ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getSessionId().toString();
                sauceClient = new SauceREST(sauceUser, sauceKey, DataCenter.US);

            }
  ```

At the bottom of the list of `sauceOptions`, underneath the `sauceOptions.setCapability("name", testName)` add in two more capabilities; `tunnelIdentifier` (for **Tunnel Name**) and 'parentTunnel' (for **Owner**):

```
    sauceOptions.setCapability("tunnelIdentifier", "walkerlj_tunnel_id"     
    sauceOptions.setCapability("parentTunnel", "walkerlj");
```

Now you can run `mvn clean test` to run the test on Sauce Labs.

## 2.03 Tunnel Pools
Duration: 0:05:00


In this section, you will learn about using **tunnel pools**. These are groups of persistent tunnels that are always available to an organization or team (they aren't stopped after a test).

This lesson covers:

* How to start a new shared tunnel alongside an existing tunnel, with the same name
* Start groups of shared tunnels using the `--tunnel-pool` capability
* Run a test through shared tunnel

Typically, instances of the high availability tunnel are created and spun up with the same name (on the same server or different servers) as a shared tunnel so users in an organization can access tunnels as needed without having to start their own.

To follow along, edit the code to run a test using [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ. (Copy the tests in `/java_tests` and run your tests from there).

### Start Tunnel Pools

To start a tunnel pool and create a resilient system for your team to run tests in, simply start a test as you normally with a `-s` flag for a shared tunnel and `--tunnel-pool` with Sauce Connect 4.6.5 +, like so:

```
bin/sc -u your-username -k ******************** -i your_tunnel_id -s --tunnel-pool
```
Typically when you start a tunnel somewhere, you have tunnel that is running 24-7, however if you or someone in your organization were to start two tunnels with the same name on the same server, they would 'collide' and stop running.

#### Start a Second Tunnel

Now, to illustrate how high-availability tunnels work, we will start another tunnel with the same name (in a new terminal window):

```
bin/sc -u your-username -k ******************** -i your_tunnel_id -s --tunnel-pool
```

Since you have more than one tunnel with the same name, when others in your organization use that tunnel, the traffic will be balanced across these tunnels, and if one tunnel goes down, you will still be able to run tests without having to change the tunnel name.

<img src="assets/SC2.03B.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

### Adding Resiliency
There are two ways that your automated test runs may fail when using Sauce Connect, since they do not self-heal or restart automatically:

1. A tunnel could fail
2. Your server hosting the tunnel crashes and your connection is severed

To protect against tunnnel unavailability, you should start more than one tunnel, hosted on more than one server:

<img src="assets/SC2.03A.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>



#### Restarting Tunnels
It's important to setup your tunnels to restart every 24 hours in order to improve resiliency. There are many services available to schedule a task such as stopping and restarting your Sauce Connect Tunnels. If you are using a Unix system (Mac or Linux) you can use a [Cron  daemon](https://kb.iu.edu/d/afiz).

### Persistent and On-Demand Tunnels
With Sauce Connect, you have the option to either start tunnels as they are needed, or _On-Demand_, or you can keep tunnels running at all time, as _Persistent_ tunnels.

#### On-Demand
Typically, On-Demand tunnels are useful for quick or one-off tests, and are also an option to use if you are automating the creation of your app in CI.

#### Persistent
In many situations having shared, high availability Persistent tunnels are an advantage.

You can have a team dedicated to monitoring these tunnels, getting logs when errors occur, and make sure you have a resilient setup for the tunnels you use, with more than one tunnel running on more than one server, and tunnels being restarted every 24 hours.

In the next lesson, you will see an example of how you can automate the restarting of those tunnels.

## 2.04 Create Bash Scripts to Restart Tunnels

One way you can automatically restart a tunnel is to create bash scripts to start and stop a sauce connect tunnel, and run these automatically every day.
In this lesson, you will learn to:

* Create scripts to:
  * Start multiple tunnels
  * Kill all your running tunnels
* Create `crontab` jobs to run the start & kill your tunnels every 24 hours

In order to kick off a script that will execute the starting and stopping of Sauce Labs tunnels, you can use the `crontab` command to create a file that will start the scripts.

### Create Script Files
First, create two bash scripts on your computer, one named `start.sh` and the other called `kill.sh`. You can create these files with the `touch` command like so:

```
touch kill.sh
```
```
touch start.sh
```

### Add Code to `kill.sh`

The `kill.sh` script will kill any existing tunnels you have running. In this script, update the `tunnelname` variable with the name you plan on using for your high-availability tunnels.

```
#!/bin/bash
#Kill  tunnels with a -SIGINT hard kill.  Will cause jobs in tunnel to error.

tunnelname=your_tunnel_id

echo "Killing $tunnelname processes"
for x in $(ps aux | grep "\s$tunnelname\s" | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }' );
do
  kill -SIGINT $x
  echo "$tunnelname tunnel with PID $x was sent kill -SIGINT"
done

echo "all $tunnelname tunnels given the kill signal"
```

### Add Code to `start.sh`
To restart the tunnel, create the `start.sh` script that will start a pool of tunnels. For the variables `user=`, `key=`you will need to add you Sauce username and access key.

For `tunnelname=`, and `sc-path=` you will need to add the name you will use for your high availability tunnels, and the path to where you installed Sauce Connect (and the correct version) on your machine. You will also want to make sure `sc_path=` lists the latest version of [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/index.html) (also should be installed on your machine):

```
#!/bin/bash
# DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DERIVE MEANING FROM THESE TUNNEL NAMES!!
# Each tunnel pool gets 10 ports

user=your_username
key=xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
tunnelname=your_tunnel_id
tunnels=3
tunnel_port_num=5000
sc_path=/Users/youruser/Documents/sc-4.x.x-operatingsystem/bin/sc

for tunnel in $(seq 1 $tunnels);
do
    if [[ ! $(ps aux | grep sc_$tunnelname-$tunnel_port_num | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }') ]]; then
        $sc_path -u $user -k $key --tunnel-name $tunnelname --tunnel-pool -d /tmp/sc_$tunnelname-$tunnel_port_num -s -v --extra-info '{"inject_job_id":true}' &
        sleep 5
    fi

    tunnel_port_num=$((tunnel_port_num+1))
done
```

Test our your scripts by running them on your machine. Start with the `chmod` command to give the permission these two bash scripts to execute on your machine:

### Update Permissions To Run `bash` Scripts

When you create bash scripts, you need to let your system know what permission those script have in terms of changing files, directories, settings, and more. The `chmod` command allows you to set those permissions for each script.

For each of the scripts you created, [set the permissions](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php) to read write, and execute as needed:

```
chmod 740 start.sh
```
```
chmod 740 kill.sh
```
### Run Your Scripts
Before you rely on the cron tab to run your scripts, you will probably want to test them out. navigate to the folder where you saved the scripts, and run the command:

```
sudo bash ./start.sh
```
You should see three Sauce Connect tunnel start in your console and on the [Sauce Labs app](https://app.saucelabs.com/tunnels).


<img src="assets/SC2.04A.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="750"/>

Once you have verification that your script is running, try out the kill command:

```
sudo bash ./kill.sh

```
You should see a verification on your console that the tunnels have been shut down, as well as on the Sauce Labs [tunnels page](https://app.saucelabs.com/tunnels).

<img src="assets/SC2.04B.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="750"/>

### Using Cron with Sauce Connect `bash` Scripts

Next Create a crontab file with the command `crontab -e`.

Use [vim](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-do-i-save-changes-in-vim/) (`vim crontab`) to insert and save the timing for when you want to run your files, and the path to the bash script it will execute.

This will execute the `start.bash` script every hour, which will check if you have a tunnel up, and if not, start one:
```
0 * * * * /Users/yourusername/Documents/start.bash
```
This will execute the `kill.bash` script at 1 am every day, then execute the `start.bash` script at 1:15 am to start 3 new tunnels:

```
0 1 * * * /Users/yourusername/Documents/kill.bash
15 1 * * * /Users/yourusername/Documents/start.bash
```

#### Note
Negative
: You can use [`crontab guru`](https://crontab.guru/examples.html) to configure how frequently your bash script will run. Any time you want to access all cron jobs, simply use the command `crontab -e`


<!--
 #### Note
Negative
: **Use systemd to Manage Tunnels â€“ **
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is a system and service manager for Linux that, among other things, can be used to control the starting and stopping of services. For instructions on how to set up systemd, check the `sc-x.x.x-osx` package that you installed, inside the `/config-examples/systemd` folder, and open the `README`. This contains instructions for setting up Sauce Connect with systemd on your Linux machine. <img src="assets/SC2.03C.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="650"/>
-->


#### Run Tests with High Availability Tunnels

Once you have several tunnels configured to restart on more than one machine, and have several tunnels up and running with the same tunnel id (name) you can [run any of your tests the same way you would with any parent tunnel](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module2-SauceConnect/index.html?index=..%2F..sauceconnect#1),

You have now set up resilient, secure testing infastructure with the Sauce Labs Cloud, which comes with the peace of mind that if a single tunnel or server fails, your tests will still run and you can deliver digital confidence.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## 2.05 Set Up Sauce Connect in CI
Duration: 0:03:00

In this module, we will explore how and when a Sauce Connect tunnel can be used with a Continuous Integration (CI) tool. CI tools are used to start automated tests, and can also be used to spin up (host) an instance of the application you are testing.

### Test Scenarios

There are different ways you can configure the setup of your application (system) under test, your test suites, the Sauce Connect host, and the Sauce Labs Cloud of virtual machines. There are two main ways to do this.

* Hosting your system under test, and Sauce Connect tunnel on a the same private network
* Building your system under test and Sauce Connect tunnel in the CI tool for testing

With either of these situations, you can run your tests from wherever you would like: Your local machine, CI tool, the private network your app is hosted on, your kid's iPad, wherever your tests can reach the Sauce Labs Cloud.  

<img src="assets/SC2.05F.png" alt="SC Setups" width="750"/>

The most important thing you need to understand is that the **Sauce Connect proxy needs to be reachable or running in the same environment that your system under test is running** (or reachable on same network).

In this module, you will work with an example setting up Sauce Connect in a CI environment, however, keep in mind that if your app is hosted on a private network, and you try to follow the example in this course, you app won't be able to connect through Sauce Connect.

<img src="assets/SC2.05G.png" alt="SC Setup Can't Connect" width="750"/>

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## 2.06 Sauce Connect Example with Github Actions
Duration: 0:07:00

In this lesson you will be creating a repo in GitHub actions that includes a Selenium Java test and a workflow that can run a Sauce Connect tunnel in Github actions, and test against the [a Demo app](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/).

* Get what you'll need
* Create [a GitHub Repo](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions) for your action & tests
* Create GitHub Secrets

Though this app is publicly hosted and doesn't require a secure tunnel to be accessed, this tutorial will walk you through the steps to access test the app with GitHub Actions using a Sauce Connect tunnel as an example of what you would do to test a an app you would build in GitHub Actions, or of how you could setup CI on your private network.

### What You'll Need
* [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
* [Sauce Labs Account](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)
* [Tests](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions/tree/main/java_tests) for your [Demo App](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)
* The following permissions in GitHub:
    * The ability to create and manage workflows
    * The ability to create and store [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)

_Learn more at the [Github Actions Homepage](https://github.com/features/actions)._
### Set Up Your Project

#### Create a Project for Your Action and Tests
First, you will need to create a repo where you will put your tests, build your app, and start a Sauce Connect tunnel.

You can fork and clone/ download the demo repo if you want to follow along. Name your repo it whatever you wish.

<img src="assets/TRT2.05C.png" alt="Set up Github repo" width="450"/>


We will set up our test to run on every push request made to the main branch of a repository.


### Create GitHub Secrets

The first order of business is to export your [Sauce Labs account credentials](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings) and store them as GitHub Secrets.

1. Navigate to your project repository and select the __settings__ icon


2. Select __Secrets__
3. Click the __New secret__ button
4. Add the following:
    * Name: `SAUCE_USERNAME`
    * Value: `your-sauce-username`
5. Click __Add secret__ to finish.
6. Repeat the same steps above for your `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`, and make up a value for `SAUCE_TUNNEL_NAME` (Not sure where to find `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` in Sauce Labs? They're [here](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)).

<img src="assets/SC2.05E.png" alt="Github Secrets" width="750"/>

#### Create YAML File

In your project file (in this example we will test against a public demo web app) create a directory called `.github`, then within that, create a directory called `workflows`.

We will need to create a new `.yml` file [like this example](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/demo-sauce-connect/blob/main/ci-examples/githubActionsExample.yml) that is used to give instructions to Github Actions.

This file will define the test jobs that will run on certain triggers called [events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).

Create a new file called `sc-actions-demo.yml`:

<img src="assets/SC2.05A.png" alt="The YML file" width="450"/>


### Set Up the Workflow Trigger and Secrets

In the `sc-actions-demo.yml` file, use vim to or an IDE to copy and paste in the following:


```
# This workflow will do a clean install of Java & Maven, start a Sauce Connect tunnel, then run a Java Test suite with that tunnel
name: Sample Java Test with Sauce Connect

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - diego-changes
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
  # ...
```

This first part of the code sets up your workflow to run when the `main` or `diego-changes` branch has a push to it, and the `worflow_dispatch` allows you to manually trigger a run within the UI

<img src="assets/SC2.06A.png" alt="Trigger workflow" width="750"/>

See [more about triggering workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).

Next, we will add in Secrets to use. You want to make sure that you use the same tunnel name in both the test and your automated tests. In the `sc-actions-demo.yml` file add your secrets below the actions you set to trigger:

```
#...
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - diego-changes
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

env:
  SAUCE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_USERNAME }}
  SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY }}
  SAUCE_TUNNEL_NAME: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_TUNNEL_NAME }}
  BUILD_PREFIX: true
#...
```
This will pull the secrets you set up for this project or environment. Note how [in the `Config.java` file](https://github.com/walkerlj0/sauceconnect-github-actions/blob/main/java_tests/src/test/java/tests/Config.java) you have the same variables set for your sauce username, access key, and tunnel name:

```
// filename: tests/Config.java
package tests;

public class Config {
    public static final String baseUrl = System.getProperty("baseUrl", "http://the-internet.herokuapp.com");
    public static final String host = System.getProperty("host", "saucelabs");
    public static final String browserName = System.getProperty("browserName", "chrome");
    public static final String browserVersion = System.getProperty("browserVersion", "75.0");
    public static final String platformName = System.getProperty("platformName", "Windows 10");
    public static final String sauceUser = System.getenv("SAUCE_USERNAME");
    public static final String sauceKey = System.getenv("SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY");
    public static final String sauceTunnel = System.getenv("SAUCE_TUNNEL_NAME");

}
```
### Create Jobs in Github Actions
Now we will define the job(s) you will use to start a Sauce Connect Tunnel, Build your app, and setup the envionment for your tests and run them.

#### Note
Negative
: This example would actually not work unless you also added your app code to this repository. Remember, **A Sauce Connect Tunnel must be started in the same environment your app is hosted in** to work. Since this Github Actions sets up a tunnel, your app would need to be built in GitHub Actions as well.

This is a _bad_ example, since this will actually test against a public app in another environment, but will give an example of starting a tunnel in GitHub actions where you can build your app.

Add the job to set up Sauce Connect, and below it is a good place to add the code to build your app:

```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Sauce Connect Action
        uses: saucelabs/sauce-connect-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_USERNAME }}
          accessKey: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY }}
          tunnelIdentifier: ${{ secrets.SAUCE_TUNNEL_NAME }}
          scVersion: 4.6.4

      #- name: Build Your App
          # Add code here to build your app
```

Note that you will want to update the `scVersion:` with the most [up to date version](https://docs.saucelabs.com/secure-connections/sauce-connect/installation/#downloading-sauce-connect-proxy) that you plan to use.

Last, add in the code to build yorr app, and setup & run the example test suite:

```
#- name: Build Your App
    # Add code here to build your app

- name: Set up JDK 1.8
  uses: actions/setup-java@v1
  with:
    java-version: 1.8
- name: Run tests
  continue-on-error: true
  run: cd java_tests && mvn test
```
Note how the last command to actually `run:` your tests first changes directory to the `java/tests` folder, then runs the test with Maven, which should already exist on the virtual machine/ container where your app, test, and Sauce Connect tunnel are being hosted.

Now, when you push a change, you should see a successful workflow run under the **Actions**

<img src="assets/SC2.06B.png" alt="Actions Workflow" width="750"/>

### Support

Sauce Connect logs are hard, and we have experts to help you. Visit **[support.saucelabs.com](https://support.saucelabs.com)** to get help with your Sauce Connect issues. Having log files ready will help speed up the process.

* Tunnel logs can be obtained by adding the -v flag to your start-up command

* Fresh logs are the easiest for support to read, so it may be helpful to rename the old log file, then re-run your tunnel so a new one gets created. Alternatively you can specify a new file for test runs with the `-l <file>` command when you run your test
