## 2.02 Shared Tunnels
Duration: 0:06:00

In this section, you will learn about using shared tunnels, and edit the code to run a test using the tunnel and [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ. This lesson covers:

* The different permissions for Sauce Labs accounts, and how they affect tunnels
* How to start a shared tunnel that others can use
* How to update Java test code to run your test through a shared tunnel by updating the `parentTunnel` capability.

: If you clone & fork or download [the example repo called Selenium_Course_Example_Code](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06), make sure you navigate to the _java/Mod4/4.06_ directory and open and run your tests from there. Learn more about [setting up a Java test environment](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SeleniumJava/index.html?index=..%2F..SeleniumJava#4).

Shared tunnels are tunnels that are started by one person in an organization, that can be used by other inidividuals within that organization. Though anyone can run the `-s` flag, tunnels are only shared with others if you are and Admin or Team Admin in your Sauce Labs account.

### Sauce Labs Account Access
There are different roles that individuals in an organization can have within Sauce Labs. The most common ones include:

#### Org Admin
This is the highest level of access for a Sauce Labs Account. These user can:
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels (in any team)
* Can manage account, and add and move members between teams
* Can promote peoples' access rights to Team or Org Admins
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone in the organization
* Can stop all tunnels in their organization

#### Team Admins
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels in their team
* Can manage accounts on their team, and add people to their team, and move members from the _default_ team
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone on their team

#### Team Member
* Can run tests on their own tunnels or on tunnels that are shared with them
* Can manage their own account
* Can see team members' tests (if that is available for their organization)
* Can start tunnels that others in their team can use

### Start a Shared Tunnel

Starting a shared tunnel is as easy as adding a flag when you run your tunnel, [like you did earlier](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-SauceConnect/index.html?index=..%2F..sauceconnect#start-the-tunnel). The basic steps include:

* Navigate to the folder where you have the Sauce Connect Software downloaded
* Start a tunnel with the command, adding the `-s` flag to the end:

```
bin/sc -u Lindsayw34 -k xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxx -i Lindsayw34_tunnel_id -s
```
<img src="assets/SC2.02B.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="650"/>

Now on the Sauce Labs dashboard, under the **Tunnels** tab, you can see a shared tunnel on your dashboard:

<img src="assets/SC2.02C.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

#### Tunnel Information
In order for other users in your organization to utilize your test, they will need two pieces of information, the **Tunnel Name** and **Owner**

In this example, the tunnel name is `walkerlj_tunnel_id` and the owner is `walkerlj`.

### Using a Shared Tunnel with a Java Test
Using a shared tunnel to run your test is done in a very similar way, you simply need to add an extra capabilities.

To use a shared tunnel create or copy [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ.

#### Update `BaseTest.java`
To run a test through this login to a user account that is different than the use who is running the test, and check the **Tunnels** dashboard to find the the **Tunnel Name** and **Owner** for the tunnel:

<img src="assets/SC2.02D.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

Now open your copy of the [example test](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06).

Navigate to the directory _src/test/java_ and look in the `tests` directory to open `BaseTest.java`. Find the set of capabilities in the `before()` method for for `(host.equals("saucelabs")) {`:


  ```
  @Override
        protected void before() throws Exception {
            if (host.equals("saucelabs")) {
                MutableCapabilities sauceOptions = new MutableCapabilities();
                sauceOptions.setCapability("username", sauceUser);
                sauceOptions.setCapability("accessKey", sauceKey);
                sauceOptions.setCapability("name", testName);
                MutableCapabilities capabilities = new
                // add tunnel capabilities
                MutableCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("browserName", browserName);
                capabilities.setCapability("browserVersion", browserVersion);
                capabilities.setCapability("platformName", platformName);
                capabilities.setCapability("sauce:options", sauceOptions);
                String sauceUrl = String.format("https://ondemand.saucelabs.com/wd/hub");
                driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(sauceUrl), capabilities);
                sessionId = ((RemoteWebDriver) driver).getSessionId().toString();
                sauceClient = new SauceREST(sauceUser, sauceKey, DataCenter.US);

            }
  ```

At the bottom of the list of `sauceOptions`, underneath the `sauceOptions.setCapability("name", testName)` add in two more capabilities; `tunnelIdentifier` (for **Tunnel Name**) and 'parentTunnel' (for **Owner**):

```
    sauceOptions.setCapability("tunnelIdentifier", "walkerlj_tunnel_id"     
    sauceOptions.setCapability("parentTunnel", "walkerlj");
```

Now you can run `mvn clean test` to run the test on Sauce Labs.

## 2.03 High Availability Tunnels
Duration: 0:05:00


In this section, you will learn about using **high availability tunnels**. These are persistent tunnels that are always available to an organization or team (they are't stopped after a test).

Typically, instances of the high availability tunnel are created and spun up with the same name (on the same server or different servers), typically as a shared tunnel so users in an organization can access tunnels as needed without having to start their own.

This lesson covers:

* How to start a new shared tunnel alongside an existing tunnel, with the same name
* How to update Java test code to run your test through a shared tunnel by updating the `--no-remove-colliding-tunnels` capability.

To follow along, edit the code to run a test using [this example test written](https://github.com/walkerlj0/Selenium_Course_Example_Code/tree/master/java/Mod4/4.06) in Java, JUnit4, with Maven and InteliiJ. (Copy the tests in `/java/Mod4/4.06` and run your tests from there).

### Start High Availability Tunnels

To start a high-availability tunnel and create a resilient system for your team to run tests in, simply start a test as you normally with a `-s` flag for a shared tunnel and `--no-remove-colliding-tunnels` with Sauce Connect 4.6.5 +, like so:

```
bin/sc -u your-username -k ******************** -i your_tunnel_id -s --no-remove-colliding-tunnels
```
Typically when you start a tunnel somewhere, you have tunnel that is running 24/7, however if you or someone in your organization were to start two tunnels with the same name on the same server, they would 'collide' and stop running.

#### Start a Second Tunnel

Now, to illustrate how high-availability tunnels work, we will start another tunnel with the same name (in a new terminal):

```
bin/sc -u your-username -k ******************** -i your_tunnel_id -s --no-remove-colliding-tunnels
```

Since you have more than one tunnel with the same name, when others in your organization use that tunnel, the traffic will be balanced across these tunnels, and if one tunnel goes down, you will still be able to run tests without having to change the tunnel name.

### Adding Resiliency
There are two ways that your automated test runs may fail when using Sauce Connect, since they do not self-heal or restart automatically:

1. A tunnel could fail
2. Your server hosting the tunnel crashes and your connection is severed

To protect against tunnnel unavailability, you should start more than one tunnel, hosted on more than one server:

<img src="assets/SC2.03A.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="850"/>

#### Use systemd to Manage Tunnels
[systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) is a system and service manager for Linux that, among other things, can be used to control the starting and stopping of services.

For instructions on how to set up systemd, check the `sc-x.x.x-osx` package that you installed, inside the `/config-examples/systemd` folder, and open the `README`. This contains instructions for setting up Sauce Connect with systemd on your Linux machine.

<img src="assets/SC2.03C.png" alt="Start a shared tunnel" width="650"/>

The systemd service will automatically start the Sauce Connect service, monitor each client, and tranparently restart the client if the client gets disconnected or a tunnel goes down.

There are two other files besides the README in the `/systemd` directory:
* The `sc.service` file describes the service
* The `sc@.service` creates an instance of a Sauce Connect tunnel that the service will start.

#### Restarting Tunnels
It's important to setup your tunnels to restart every 24 hours in order to reduce to improve resiliency. If you take a look at the

//read about/ ask Max for 'restart code' example-- is it in systemd? Como?
// got stuck on parts 2 & 3 of step 5
