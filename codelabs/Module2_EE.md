## Outcome Expectations

Users who complete all modules of this course can expect to complete tasks described below.  These courses do not represent an endorsement by Sauce Labs of a particular language or framework or combination of the two.

### Users Will Be Able To:

* Read and understand basic Selenium tests that use the language and framework combination addressed by the course
* Write simple tests that follow patterns covered in the course
* Understand, edit, and maintain test code written with the same or similar languages, frameworks, and tools

### Sauce Labs-specific Tasks Including:

* Connect tests to the Sauce Labs cloud for automated web browser testing
* Passing test information to Sauce Labs such as names and pass/fail status
* Run a simple test using Sauce Connect proxy
* Run a test suite using the Jenkins CI server and Sauce OnDemand

Users will also experience challenges specific to their local environments. Sauce Labs ability to assist with these issues is limited. However, we encourage you to report such issues through The ‘Report an Issue’ link so that we can work to add content to help future users
