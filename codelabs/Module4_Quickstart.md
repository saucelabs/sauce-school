## 4.01 What You'll Learn
Duration: 0:01:00

### iOSAppium Tutorial
In this module, you will be walked through an example of setting up and running an Appium Java test with Android, covering two specific cases:
* Testing an [iOS mobile application]() on Sauce Labs Emulators
* Testing an [iOS mobile web]() application on the Sauce Labs Emulators

Both of these tests will be created using the **Appium driver, Java, and the TestNG test runner**, and will be run locally and using the virtual devices on the Sauce Labs Cloud.

### Skills & Knowledge

* Learn about how to set up your environment to run an Appium mobile app or mobile browser test
