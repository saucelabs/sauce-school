# Module 4 – Advanced API Test Creation

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## 4.01 Validate Metrics Within a Test
Duration: 0:02:00

Monitoring your internal APIs is always a good step for keeping track of its performance. When building tests to monitor the performance of your API, we recommend not only testing for functionality and load but also testing for metrics such as fetch, latency, and overall times.  

These performance metrics can be turned into an assertion themselves using the [_assert-less_ component](https://apifortress.com/doc/assertions-for-metrics-performance/).  

The platform also has a robust dashboard that allows for detailed notifications in terms of global performance.   

These metrics can also be pulled from our Insights API and put into any analytics platform of your choice that supports JSON inputs. The data can be pulled all at once or in a streaming fashion. Learn more in the [API documentation.](https://apifortressv3.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/insights/metrics)
