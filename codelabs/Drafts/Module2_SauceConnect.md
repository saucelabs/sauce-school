## 2.02 Shared Tunnels
Duration: 0:06:00

Shared tunnels are tunnels that are started by one person in an organization, that can be used by other inidividuals within that organization. Though anyone can run the `-s` flag, tunnels are only shared with others if you are and Admin or Team Admin in your Sauce Labs account.

* Can manage account, and add and move members between teams

* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone in the organization
* Can stop all tunnels in their organization

#### Team Admins
* See all tests and Sauce Connect tunnels in their team
* Can manage accounts on their team, and add people to their team, and move members from the _default_ team
* Can create shared tunnels to be used by anyone on their team

#### Team Member
* Can run tests on their own tunnels or on tunnels that are shared with them
* Can manage their own account
