### Time Required
6-8 hours of basic instruction on Selenium using the language and framework specified in the course.


### Recommended Experience Level

This course is designed for users with some coding experience who want to learn automation.
* Users should have experience with setting up and troubleshooting the required development environment and should expect to do so without assistance from Sauce Labs.
* Users should expect to do some troubleshooting with setting up the environment, and have the ability and resources to use third party documentation (such as Java docs) to get their environment working.
