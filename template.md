# Module X â€“ Title of codelab
Add Sections and Durations
Then for each section use Header 2 or '##' and specify an optional duration beneath for time remaining calculations Optional section times will be used to automatically total and remaining tutorial times In markdown I've found that the time is formatted hh:mm:ss

Example

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Section 1
Duration: 0:10:00

### Info Boxes
Plain Text followed by green and yellow info boxes

<aside class="negative">
You created a yellow side note!
</aside>

Some other things you can don in a yellow note include making <strong>bold text</strong, or <i>Italic text</i> or highlight <code>text as code</code>

You can create a list
<li> with the li tag</li>
</aside>

### Bullets
Plain Text followed by bullets
* Hello

* World

You created bullets!

### Numbered List

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Section 2

### Add a Link
Adding a link!
`[Example of a Link](https://www.google.com)`


### Images
<img src="codelabs/assets/filename.png" alt="Example Tag Component"/>

### Embed YouTube Video
You can embed videos from YouTube using the YouTUbe video ID like so:
_Video ID can be found in the url following v=_

`<video id="DWAinkJ54D8"></video>`
<video id=""></video>

### Embed an iframe
`![EmbeddedURL](SharedURL)`

### Add Code Samples
All code samples must begin and end with three tick marks:

```
this.is.code.text.here () {
  any language can be(used)
}
```

in paragraph code `can be added` with single tick marks.

### Size Images
You can add in a sized image with the `<img/>` tag. As an example take this image in markdown and resize it with the `width` property:
`<img src="assets/2.02C.png" alt="Pencil" width="150"/>`


### Embed Video/ Form from Google Drive
Use the same markdown as embedding an iframe: _Not Recommended_
`![EmbedURL](ShareURL)`

##### EmbedURL
**Video**
1. Double click on the Video to open it
2. once it's open click the three dots in upper left and choose 'Open in New Window'
3. In the new window, click on the three dots at the top left and choose 'embed item' copy the URL from the src="" (what is in the quotation marks)

**Google Form**
1. Click the 'Send' button.
2. Choose the third tab with the embed icon `<>`. YOu should see an `<iframe>` tag.
3. Copy the link after the 'src' that is in quotes

#### ShareURL
this can simply be found by clicking on the 'copy link' from the folder the video is in, and use the URL that you would use to share.
